## Command line scripts

This folder is indended to be a repository for command line scripts. Those scripts are static and
won't allow you to do logic like the python layer, however, are the easiest way to interact with
the simulator.

You can always run arbitrary CL scripts via the SDK like:

```bash
python syncity.py -r <path/to/script.cl>
```

Or by simply connecting to the simulator via telnet and pasting the script contents directly.
