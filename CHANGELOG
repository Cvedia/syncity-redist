- New DataExport module, standarizing all types of data exports into a single component
- Arbitrary data types (float, int, vector3, etc) exports to json support
- Data exports are now timestamped individually, allowing for very precise data synchronization
- Mixed data exports (video, image, data) in the same synchronizer package are now supported
- SDK DataExport function support and deprecation of old methods
- SDK graceful deprecation of VideoExport and ImageExport methods
- SDK misc refactoring
- DataExports can now be paused and resumed at any point
- Forest thermal script changes; Added new data export module support
